## <a name="anchor1"></a>What is Technical Documentation?

* Contains information on a particular product.
* Modular topics.
* E.g:
  * User manuals
  * Training materials
  * Help docs
  * Specifications and catalogs

All these docs provide information or guidance to do something.

### Structured Content / Standardized Content

Structured content defines the schema of the technical document. Document schema defines the elements within a technical document. Industries have different needs and requirements therefore there is no universal document schema.

### Modularity of Content

Think of modularity of content as steps to achieve a particular competency. Learning Arithmetic can be divided into modules to - *do Arithmetic*.

### Distributed Content

Technical Documentation needs to be accessible which is why tech docs are most broadly accessed through digital implementation.

# <a name="anchor2"></a>Documentation for Ethereum Classic

### Mission

To onboard new and existing developers to the Ethereum Classic ecosystem.

### Issues

* Crypto community tends to be unaware of ETH/ ETC development compatibilities.
* Ethereum and Ethereum Classic communities tend to have legacy documentation that's not maintained.
* Crypto community tends to struggle finding educational materials to becoming ETC developers and contributing valuable projects.
* Sexier documentation is a temptation always worth exploring #YOLO

**Why do developers want use Ethereum Classic?**

Developers want to use the Ethereum Classic ecosystem to create decentralized applications.

**What should the scope of the documentation be?**

The scope of the documentation would be comprised of modules, each based on a particular competency within the dApp development process.
