#  Technical Documentation

## What is Technical Documentation?

* Contains information on a particular product.
* Modular topics.
* E.g:
  * User manuals
  * Training materials
  * Help docs
  * Specifications and catalogs

All these docs provide information or guidance to do something.

## Structured Content / Standardized Content

Structured content defines the schema of the technical document. Document schema defines the elements within a technical document. Industries have different needs and requirements therefore there is no universal document schema.

## Modularity of Content

Think of modularity of content as steps to achieve a particular competency. Learning Arithmetic can be divided into modules to - *do Arithmetic*.

## Distributed Content

Technical Documentation needs to be accessible which is why tech docs are most broadly accessed through digital implementation.
