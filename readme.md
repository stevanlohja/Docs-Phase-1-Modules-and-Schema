# ETCDEV Team - ETC Documentation Initiative

This repository is a research and planning of fundamental technical documentation for Ethereum/ Ethereum Classic developers.

## Mission

To onboard new and existing developers to the Ethereum Classic ecosystem.

## Problems

* Crypto community tends to be unaware of ETH/ ETC development compatibilities.
* Ethereum and Ethereum Classic protocols tend to have legacy documentation that's not maintained.
* Crypto community tends to struggle finding educational materials to becoming ETC developers.
* dApps have higher demand than dApp developers available
* It's a valuable contribution to the ETC community ðŸ’š
* Sexier documentation is a temptation always worth exploring #YOLO
