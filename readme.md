# Ethereum Classic - ETC Documentation Initiative

**What kind of blockchain developer?**

Software Developers have different layers of actual programming and specialize in solving different solutions. A hardware programmer may know C or Verilog languages, however, a software developer may know Java or PHP.

When someone decides to become a Web Developer, they usually decide they will develop on a protocol level, data level, and application level.

ETC can be utilized as a crypto currency, create new tokens, and create smart contracts that are often utilized by decentralized applications (dApps).

An ETC developer, generally wants to create dApps, smart contracts, and to some extent, migrate ETH dApps on to the ETC network.

Examples of dApps:
* [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/): Buy, sell, and breed digital kitties.
* [ETH Lend](https://ethlend.io/en/): Value lending using Ethereum.
* [IDEX Market](https://idex.market/): Exclusive ether token exchange market.
* [Emerald Wallet](http://github.com/etcdevteam/): Wallet for Ethereum Classic.
